<p>These files are prototpyes for a homepage for the North Carolina Botanical Garden's website generated by AI chatbots in September and October 2025. This is the prompt they received:<br />
<p>"Let's start with a responsive HTML/CSS mockup. The current page is https://ncbg.unc.edu. Consider best practices for a botanical garden homepage. The page should include: • A header with space for a logo, main menu navigation, a search bar, social icons, and links to two external sites (our donation page and online shop). • A hero with a banner image and succinct headline • Responsive layouts with sections for upcoming events, news, and key programs or opportunities we want to highlight. • A footer with contact information, other relevant links, and copyright information. Please pick from the following colors, though others may be used: #583c5c, #dcdeb1, #15322d,  #016b5c, #6ca399, #ede1c7, #00bcd3, #bfca7e</p>
<p></p>Background: The North Carolina Botanical Garden is a free public garden dedicated to fostering connections between plants, people and place. We aim to use accessible, friendly language to communicate our message; our voice is warm but also knowledgeable. Our website serves a few purposes: it helps people plan their visit to our gardens and natural areas; encourages them to sign up for educational programs and to attend events; encourages them to become a member or donor; and provides useful information about native plant gardening and identification in the southeastern U.S. We also have a few opportunities we’d like to direct users’ attention to, including the Home of the Venus Flytrap license plate, a specialty plate whose proceeds support plant conservation in North Carolina; the FloraQuest apps, a suite of mobile plant identification and discovery apps that cover 19 states; and our online Garden Shop, hosted on an external site."</p>
