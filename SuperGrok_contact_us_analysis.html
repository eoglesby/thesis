My research would involve field playbacks, where I play synthetic calls to calling males and record their aggressive responses. This would necessitate nighttime fieldwork, and I know your locations likely close at dusk, so I wanted to ask for permission. Additionally, I would also like to toe clip the males I have tested to avoid re-testing and to collect DNA samples to attempt to correlate their genes with their behavioral responses, since this species is suspected to hybridize with the [other amphibian species] in certain parts of its range. I have applied for the appropriate permits through NC Wildlife and have filed an IACUC application through UNC, and am currently waiting to hear back from them (hopefully this week). Finally, if I can secure access to a canoe, it would be extremely helpful to also be able to use that in some of the ponds in your parks, as it can be difficult to avoid sinking when wading into the mud near where these frogs call. [Species] are not endangered, nor are they a protected species, so I just wanted to make sure that these research activities would be permissible at your site.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, and I am happy to provide more details about my proposed research!\n\nBest,\n[Name]\",5/11/25 14:17,\r\nGeneral inquiries,\"Hi!

As you might know, some plants are more sensitive to ground-level ozone pollution than others and can serve as bioindicators, and we can monitor foliar injury to better understand local air quality and effects on plants. \n\nWe have already planted cutleaf coneflower (Rudbeckia laciniata), which is one of the bioindicator species recommended for the Piedmont region, but we are also hoping to plant yellow crownbeard (Verbesina occidentalis). We can't find it anywhere in North Carolina and wondered if you might have some since you are listed as a place for sourcing plants in Clean AIRE's ozone garden toolkit.\n\nFor now, we are going to get wingstem (Verbesina alternifolia), which is very similar, but I can't confirm anywhere online that it has the same response to ozone exposure. It could be a little research project to see if it does, but it'd still be ideal to have the V. occidentalis to compare it to.\n\nThank you so much for any guidance you can provide on where to source this plant!\n\nBest,\n[Name]\",6/6/25 11:48,\r\nNCBG Daily Plant Sale and Nursery,\"Hello, I'm the owner of [Name] located outside of [place].

I am with the [Name]\ngarden club and we are interested in learning about winter gardens, \nor perhaps other topics, and meet locally.  We are looking for a speaker on March 6 for a short program.\nThank you,\",2/21/25 9:29,\r\nYouth and family programs,\"Hello, I am the program manager for the [program] out of the [UNC school].  We support families of children with disabilities and special healthcare needs.  I was wondering if we might be able to work together to provide a Family Time activity event for families in the area who have children with special needs.  I would love to help host a get together time  in the Peacock Room specifically for these families to have some fellowship while their children do an accessible activity.  Oftentimes, these families do not get to take advantage of our local resources because there may be too many children and/or they are concerned about how their children will interact with or be treated by some of the other typically developing c hildren.  We spoke with a mom today who referenced taking her two young sons to the Botanical Gardens and that she would love to meet some other families who have children with special healthcare needs in a space like yours because her children are comfortable there and they would like to meet families like theirs in these natural play areas.\nI would love to talk further about setting something like this up, even if it's just a short 2 hour event one week day.\nThank you,\n[Name]\",11/20/24 14:26,\r\nYouth and family programs,\"Good afternoon, \n\nI'm the new STEAM specials teacher at [school]. Our previous science teacher, [Name], worked with you to create a pollinator garden in 2018. Unfortunately no one was able to maintain the garden during the pandemic. My k-5th graders are very eager to restore the garden to its former glory and to learn more about native plants. Is there someone who might be able to assist us as we plan for the plants we will put in and what other considerations we should be making?\nThank you, \n[Name]\",9/24/24 16:13,\r\nYouth and family programs,\"Hello! My name is [Name]. I am a junior studying Elementary Education, and special education, at [University]. I am wondering about Camp Flytrap, would I, as an education major be able to apply to a 'counselor' position for the 2025 summer?

              The analysis of 141 "Contact Us" form submissions reveals that <strong>Facility rentals</strong> (24.1%) and <strong>Class registration</strong> (16.3%) are the most common topics. Key pain points include registration errors, unclear program details, and membership management issues. Negative sentiment is highest in Class registration (21.7% negative). Submission spikes occurred in April (19) and May (17) 2025, likely due to spring event planning.
